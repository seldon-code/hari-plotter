class Dynamics:
    """
    HariDynamics manages a list of LazyHariGraph objects that represent HariGraph instances.

    This class facilitates the batch processing of multiple LazyHariGraph instances. It allows for reading multiple
    networks and opinions, and provides a unified interface to access and manipulate each LazyHariGraph.

    Attributes:
        lazy_hari_graphs (list[LazyHariGraph]): A list of LazyHariGraph objects.
        groups (list[list[int]]): A list where each element is a list of indices representing a group.

    Methods:
        initialized: Returns indices of initialized LazyHariGraph instances.
        uncluster: Resets clustering for all LazyHariGraph instances.
        read_network: Reads network and opinion files to create and add LazyHariGraph objects.
        __getitem__: Allows indexing to access individual LazyHariGraph instances.
        __iter__: Allows iteration over LazyHariGraph instances.
        __getattr__: Allows dynamic attribute access, attempting to get the attribute from LazyHariGraph instances.

    Note:
        Any attribute that isn't directly found on a HariDynamics object will attempt to be retrieved from its
        LazyHariGraph objects. If the attribute is callable, a function will be returned that when called, will
        apply the method on all LazyHariGraph instances. If the attribute is not callable, a list of its values
        from all LazyHariGraph instances will be returned.
